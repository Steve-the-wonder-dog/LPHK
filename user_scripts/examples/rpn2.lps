- A little more complex example with some stack manipulation
- and the use of the lastx command to recover the last value of

-
- A simple demonstrration of lastx
RPN_EVAL 1 2 / view_s lastx view_s clst
-
- Using dup and lastx to separate the integer and fractional part of a number
RPN_EVAL 11 4 / dup int lastx frac view_s clst
-
- I haven't checked on my HP calculators.  Does it handle -ve values correctly?
RPN_EVAL 11 4 chs / dup int lastx frac view_s clst
